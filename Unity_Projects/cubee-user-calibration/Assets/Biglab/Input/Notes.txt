WIIMOTE NOTES:

If the wiimote doesn't connect, try making sure only the one blutooth device is connected.
The Oculus rift/Vive box might count as a bluetooth device in some manner.

TODO:
Input mapping separate from source? Likewise for CustomInput object itself... 
Probably can create ScriptableObjects that encode this.
Ie) "Jump -> A" definition doesn't require to know which wiimote or the input system.
